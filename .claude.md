Build a Single‑Page Interactive Portfolio for shahanursharif.github.io

You are a senior front‑end engineer + brand designer. Create a single‑page, high‑performance portfolio inspired by the smooth, section‑by‑section interactions of https://diegosevilla.dev/ — but do not copy its design. Optimize everything for GitHub Pages hosting.

1) Project Goals

One HTML document with buttery scroll, tasteful micro‑interactions, and zero jank.

Fast initial paint (<1s on desktop, <2.5s on mid‑tier mobile), Lighthouse 95+ across PWA/SEO/Accessibility/Performance.

No fragile routing; must work perfectly on GitHub Pages with relative URLs.

Clean, modern aesthetic that matches the tagline:

“I am an engineer in brain, artist in mind.”

2) Tech Constraints (GitHub Pages‑friendly)

Stack: Static HTML + Tailwind (via CDN) + vanilla TypeScript (compiled to a single minified JS) + GSAP (for subtle animations) + Lenis (smooth scroll) — or a zero‑dep smooth‑scroll fallback if needed.

No server features (contact uses Formspree or mailto:). Avoid frameworks that need SSR.

Build output goes to /docs folder (so GitHub Pages can serve it from the main branch). All assets use relative paths.

If you decide to use Vite for TypeScript bundling, make sure base: '' and output relative, then commit the built assets under /docs.

Provide a fallback 404.html that redirects to /index.html to avoid SPA path issues (even though it’s a single page).

3) Visual Language

Style: Sleek, confident, warm. Minimal chrome. Spacious layout.

Palette: Deep ink #0B1220 (bg), Off‑white #F6F7FB (text), Accent 1 #6EE7FF (electric cyan), Accent 2 #FFB86B (mango), Muted gray #8A93A6.

Type: Headings “Inter” or “Sora”, body “Inter” or “IBM Plex Sans”. Strong typographic scale (clamp() for fluid sizes).

Iconography: Lucide icons. A few playful SVG doodles to reflect humor (see "Funny images" below).

Dark‑first design with a toggle to light mode (remember user preference via localStorage).

4) Page Structure & Interactions

Use sticky, snap‑to sections with a left rail scroll spy (hidden on mobile). Each section has an entrance animation (15–30% translateY + fade). Keep animations subtle and GPU‑friendly.

A) Hero

Tagline big & bold: “I am an engineer in brain, artist in mind.”

Sub‑copy (2 lines) summarizing 13+ years, SaaS/ERP/e‑commerce/finance, resilient founder‑to‑engineer journey.

CTA buttons: Download CV (PDF), Email, Upwork, LinkedIn, GitHub.

Metric chips (animated counters): Upwork 3331 hrs, 100% JSS, 10+ SaaS systems, 40+ shipped projects.

Background: a tastefully animated SVG brain ↔ paint‑brush motif.

B) About

Short narrative: sales → entrepreneurship → full‑stack problem solver, values: adaptability, teamwork, learning.

Quick facts grid (3–6 items): Location Perth, IELTS 6.5, ANZSCO skill assessment (3 lines), Cloud: Azure/AWS, Loves photography & guitar.

Freelancer.com (Jan 2013 – Jan 2020): 1000+ sites delivered, 40 platform projects. Product configurator, aviation marketplace, meter tracking.

Each timeline item expands on click to reveal 3–5 bullets with animated caret.

5) Funny (but classy) images & micro‑illustrations

Add a handful (3–5) of tiny, witty visuals that don’t distract:

A split brain: one half PCB traces (engineer), the other splashy paint (artist).

A rubber‑duck debugger sitting on a laptop bezel.

A rocket‑cat sticker on the laptop lid.

A coffee cup that gently steams on hover.

A tiny robot handing a paintbrush to a human hand.

Use lightweight inline SVGs (no external tracking). Each should be <10KB and lazy‑rendered only when entering viewport.

6) Performance & Accessibility Budget

Targets:
TTI < 2.5s (Moto G4), CLS < 0.05, LCP < 2.5s, JS < 120KB gzip total, Images < 300KB on first paint.

Techniques:
content-visibility:auto, prefers-reduced-motion respect, font‑display: swap, preconnect to fonts, loading="lazy" + decoding="async", SVG first, webp fallbacks.

Keyboard accessible: focus outlines, skip links, ARIA for accordions/toggles.

7) SEO & Social

Semantic landmarks, h1 once (Hero), logical h2 hierarchy.

Meta: title (60c), description (160c), canonical, robots.

JSON‑LD Person + Organization + SoftwareSourceCode for open‑source repos.

10) GitHub Pages Deployment Notes

Repo name: shahanursharif/shahanursharif.github.io (or root path served from /docs).

If using /docs approach: enable Pages → Source: main / /docs.

Commit built assets. All links/images are relative (e.g., ./assets/...). No absolute slashes.

Provide a minimal CNAME only if using a custom domain (not needed for *.github.io).

Add a lightweight /.github/workflows/pages.yml to auto‑build TS and deploy to /docs on push.

11) Files & Assets to Produce

/docs/index.html – single page.

/docs/assets/ – minified app.js, styles.css, SVGs, webp images, favicon, manifest, OG image, robots.txt, sitemap.xml.

/docs/404.html – redirect to /index.html.

/docs/resume/Shahanur-Md-Sharif-CV.pdf – for “Download CV”.

Social preview: og-cover.png (1200×630) — compose name, title, tagline, and a subtle brain/brush graphic.

12) QA Checklist (must pass)




13) Copywriting (tone & microcopy)

Confident, warm, a touch playful. Avoid jargon walls. Keep project blurbs crisp (≤ 40 words).

Sprinkle one‑liner jokes sparingly near doodles (e.g., “My rubber duck is my pair programmer.”).

14) Deliverables

A zipped /docs ready to push, plus the small TypeScript source if you used it.

A tiny README with the build command (if any) and Pages setup notes.

15) Canonical Links (use exactly)

16) Claude‑Specific Instructions (concise)

You are building a single static page optimized for GitHub Pages under the repo shahanursharif/shahanursharif.github.io (or /docs folder if serving from main branch). Use relative paths for all assets.

Style: sleek dark‑first UI, micro‑interactions inspired by diegosevilla.dev (no clones). Tagline in hero: “I am an engineer in brain, artist in mind.”

Sections (in this order): Hero → About → Experience → Featured Projects → Skills Matrix → Certifications → Education → Leadership → Media & Publications → Hobbies → Awards → References → Contact.

Insert metrics in Hero (animated counters): 3331 hrs on Upwork and 100% Job Success.

Use the Canonical Links above verbatim. For media items with placeholders, render the card but disable the button until URLs are provided.

Implement light/dark toggle with localStorage and respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Performance budget: JS ≤120KB gzip, LCP ≤2.5s, CLS ≤0.05. Lazy‑load images, inline critical CSS, and keep animations subtle.

Accessibility: keyboard nav, visible focus, ARIA for accordions and timeline.

Deploy to GitHub Pages: either commit to root (repo named *.github.io) or output to /docs and set Pages → Source to /docs. Provide a minimalist 404.html that redirects to index.html.

Do not introduce frameworks that require SSR. Prefer Tailwind via CDN + small vanilla JS. Use SVG doodles for small funny images (rubber duck, rocket‑cat, coffee steam, brain/brush) ≤10KB each.

Output: a ready‑to‑commit /docs (or root) with index.html, assets/ (minified JS/CSS + SVGs), robots.txt, sitemap.xml, manifest.json, og-cover.png, optional pages.yml workflow, and resume/Shahanur-Md-Sharif-CV.pdf placeholder.
